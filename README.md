Class Project: decode an image that contains a secret message using programming.


# Project

YOU are an adventurer and just found a picture on one of your travels. This picture is said to contain a secret message, you found some code that was used to encode these pictures but have to reverse engineer the encoding function to figure out what the original message embedded in the picture is.

Good Luck!
